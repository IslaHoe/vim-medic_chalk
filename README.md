# Foreword

I have forked this from [Tpope's Vividchalk](https://github.com/tpope/vim-vividchalk)
and slightly modified it.

All credit goes to him. Check him out. He has many great Vim plugins.

## Installation

```vimL
call plug#begin()
  Plug 'ParamagicDev/vim-medic_chalk'
call plug#end()

colorscheme medic_chalk
```

The table below contains a subset of VividChalksâ€™s palette.
It was taken from [Romainl's Apprentice](https://github.com/romainl/Apprentice) Readme
